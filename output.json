{"status":"processing","type":"veo","operation":{"name":"models/veo-2.0-generate-001/operations/9b8ie4hwaov5"},"prompt":"A highly detailed visual prompt for a 6-second cinematic video about \"Host Live Webinar: 'Tus Preguntas sobre Créditos Hipotecarios en México'\":\n\n**Shot 1 (0-1.5 seconds): Establishing Shot - The Professional Setting**\nA cinematic, slow dolly push-in opens on a modern, impeccably organized home office or professional studio. The foreground is a softly blurred, high-tech microphone and a sleek laptop showing a loading screen. In the mid-ground, a diverse financial expert (30s-40s, professional attire) sits poised, adjusting a discreet earpiece, their gaze focused just off-camera as if preparing to address a live audience. Sunlight streams through a large window, creating a warm, inviting atmosphere, casting soft, natural highlights on the expert's face. The background, slightly out of focus, reveals subtle design elements: a minimalist bookshelf with financial tomes, a large monitor displaying a placeholder graphic for a webinar, and a faint \"LIVE\" indicator. The entire scene is 4K photorealistic, with exquisite detail on materials like brushed metal, polished wood, and the subtle textures of fabrics.\n\n**Shot 2 (1.5-3.0 seconds): The Audience's Voice - Interactive Questions**\nA dynamic rack focus shot transitions from a blurred hand hovering over a keyboard to an ultra-sharp close-up of a tablet or large smartphone screen. The screen brightly displays a rapidly scrolling feed of real-time questions, all in clear Spanish, within a modern webinar chat interface. Questions like \"¿Cómo funcionan las tasas de interés variables en México?\", \"¿Cuál es el proceso para un refinanciamiento hipotecario aquí?\", and \"¿Qué documentos necesito para aplicar en bancos mexicanos?\" appear prominently, mimicking authentic user input. Subtle, photorealistic reflections of a dimly lit room are visible on the screen's surface, emphasizing its digital glow. The composition highlights the diversity and urgency of the audience's queries.\n\n**Shot 3 (3.0-4.5 seconds): The Expert's Response - Clear Guidance**\nA steady, medium close-up shot of the financial expert from Shot 1, now actively speaking directly to the camera with a confident, reassuring expression. Their eyes maintain direct contact, conveying sincerity and expertise. A subtle, elegant lower-third graphic fades in smoothly at the bottom of the screen, displaying \"HomeLoans.mx\" in a clean typeface, and below it, \"Experto Hipotecario en México.\" The professional lighting perfectly sculpts their face, highlighting their expressive eyes and confident demeanor. The background remains slightly blurred, focusing all attention on the expert's clear, informative communication. The photorealism captures every detail, from the subtle texture of their skin to the precise fall of light.\n\n**Shot 4 (4.5-6.0 seconds): Branding & Call to Action - The Webinar Reveal**\nThe final shot is a striking, cinematic split-screen or overlay composition. The left half (or dominant background) features a slightly wider, dynamic shot of the expert, still speaking and gesturing subtly, their posture conveying authority and helpfulness. The right half (or prominent overlay) is a bold, modern graphic. It features the webinar title: \"Tus Preguntas sobre Créditos Hipotecarios en México,\" rendered in a clean, impactful font with a vibrant accent color. Below this, the word \"LIVE\" (or \"EN VIVO\") pulses gently, drawing attention. At the very bottom, the \"HomeLoans.mx\" logo is prominently displayed, followed by the clear website URL \"HomeLoans.mx.\" The entire composition is brightly lit, crisp, and high-contrast, designed for immediate readability and brand recall. Subtle, elegant animation accompanies the appearance of the text elements, bringing the shot to a strong, definitive close in photorealistic 4K detail."}

{"status":"processing","type":"veo","operation":{"name":"models/veo-2.0-generate-001/operations/juruly4s5dcw"},"prompt":"A 6-second cinematic video, 4k, photorealistic.\n\n**Shot 1 (0-2s): Establishing Expertise & Brand**\nOpens with a smooth, slow cinematic dolly push-in. A confident, professional mortgage expert (e.g., a woman in her late 30s-40s, wearing a sharp, modern business blazer over a light blouse) sits slightly off-center at a sleek, minimalist desk in a bright, modern studio. The background features a large, subtly blurred digital display or projection screen with the HomeLoans.mx logo and a hint of the \"Pregunta al Experto\" title. Soft, professional studio lighting sculpts her features, highlighting a friendly yet knowledgeable expression. Shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on the expert and the immediate foreground, with bokeh in the background. High-detail textures on clothing, skin, and desk surfaces.\n\n**Shot 2 (2-4s): Dynamic Engagement & Q&A**\nCuts to a medium close-up of the expert. Her eyes are directly engaging the camera, conveying warmth and readiness to answer questions. She makes a subtle, articulate hand gesture. Overlay graphics seamlessly animate into the lower third of the screen: first, a generic thought bubble icon with a question mark, then a crisp, modern text box briefly displaying a sample question like \"Cuánto puedo pedir de hipoteca?\" or \"Cuál es la mejor tasa de interés?\" accompanied by a small, anonymous user avatar. The expert's facial expressions are dynamic, showing active listening and thoughtful explanation. The lighting remains professional, with subtle shifts as she moves.\n\n**Shot 3 (4-6s): Call to Action & Brand Reinforcement**\nTransitions smoothly to a clean, full-screen graphic overlay. The HomeLoans.mx logo is prominently centered. Below it, large, clear, and elegant typography displays: \"Pregunta al Experto: Tu Hipoteca en VIVO\". Further below, a direct call to action: \"Únete en Facebook y YouTube\" with the recognizable Facebook and YouTube social media icons. The background is a subtly animated, abstract network of glowing lines and nodes, in a sophisticated color palette of deep blues, whites, and light grays, symbolizing digital connectivity and information flow, maintaining a professional yet inviting ambiance. The text and logos are razor-sharp, with precise kerning and anti-aliasing. The animation is fluid and non-distracting, supporting the primary message."}

Item 3 (2026-02-25T20:27:24.632+00:00):
{"status":"processing","type":"veo","operation":{"name":"models/veo-2.0-generate-001/operations/6kp7484q397t"},"prompt":"**Highly cinematic, photorealistic 4K, 6-second shot.**\n\nA dynamic close-up on a sleek, ultra-high-definition tablet or laptop screen, showcasing a clean and intuitive 'Simulador de Crédito Hipotecario' interface. The screen prominently displays crisp input fields for 'Monto de Crédito', 'Tasa de Interés', and 'Plazo'. A diverse, professional-looking hand (or a pair of hands) gently and purposefully interacts with the screen, perhaps tapping an input field or adjusting a slider. Instantly and fluidly, the 'Pago Mensual' and 'Total a Pagar' figures on the screen recalculate in real-time, illuminated by a subtle digital glow. The background, bathed in soft, warm cinematic light (e.g., golden hour light filtering through a large window), is a beautifully blurred, aspirational modern home interior, subtly hinting at the dream of homeownership being calculated. Shallow depth of field, delicate lens flares, and a touch of film grain enhance the photorealistic quality. The overall mood is informative, empowering, and technologically advanced, emphasizing clarity and the ease of financial planning."}
